# 🔗 Combinational Circuits in Verilog  

Welcome to my **Combinational Circuits** playground! 🎉  
This repository is a collection of **basic to advanced combinational logic circuits** implemented in **Verilog HDL** using Vivado.  

---

## ✨ What’s Inside?
Here, you will find Verilog implementations of circuits such as:  
- 🟢 Half Adder & Full Adder  
- 🟢 Half Subtractor & Full Subtractor  
- 🟢 Multiplexers (2:1, 4:1, 8:1 …)  
- 🟢 Demultiplexers  
- 🟢 Encoders & Decoders  
- 🟢 Comparators  
- 🟢 More exciting circuits will be added 🚀

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository
The idea is not just to dump code, but to make learning **digital logic design** more **interactive and imaginative** ✨.  
Think of it like a **digital LEGO set** 🧩 — where each small circuit can be connected and expanded into bigger projects!  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Vivado Design Suite** 🖥️  
- **Verilog HDL**  

---

## 📂 How to Explore
1. Open the folder `srcs/sources_1/new/` → Contains **main Verilog codes**  
2. Open the folder `srcs/sim_1/new/` → Contains **testbenches**

## 🌟 Future Plan
After combinational circuits, I’ll also move into:  
- 🔄 Sequential Circuits (Flip-Flops, Counters, Shift Registers)  
- 🖥️ Mini-projects combining multiple blocks
